Skeeter is an IoT prank machine that allows you to emit two high-pitched noises near the edge of human hearing:

- 17.4kHz for younger people
- 8kHz for older people

It is a complete open-source hardware project built around the [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/#photon). This WiFi IoT development board lets you trigger a tone from a smartphone app, letting you leave your Skeeter in public places as a fun prank and to create mahem wherever WiFi is available. The high-pitched buzzing near the edge of their hearing is sure to annoy friends, neighbors, family, and pets using only sound!

There are four steps to building your own Skeeter:

- [Customize and 3D print the case found in this OnShape CAD project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/eaf8c742fe950d3f27224622/w/907f9782731e8bab2e05c4b4/e/c1cb65d4cc90d45319c4068d)
- Assemble the electronics as shown in the instructions
- Flash the hardware with the firmware found in this repository
- Build the Ionic application for your smartphone and install it on your device
